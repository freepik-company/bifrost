A lightweight S3 proxy that re-signs requests between your customers and buckets, supporting multiple client authentication methods.


## Motivation

Outbound traffic from S3 buckets is often expensive with many providers. Some providers treat outbound traffic as internal when it goes through alternative points other than the provided S3 endpoint, such as bare-metal machines.

In these situations, a transparent HTTP proxy isn't enough because all S3 client requests are signed at the source, and the signature includes the host. Simply rewriting this header doesn't helpâ€”the bucket will see the signature as invalid.

The simplest way to handle this is to intercept the request and re-sign it with valid data. This proxy is exactly the gateway you need.

## Flags

As almost every configuration parameter can be defined in environment vars, there are only few flags that can be defined.
They are described in the following table:

| Name              | Description                                          |    Default     | Example                  |
|:------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------|:--------------:|:-------------------------|
| `--log-level`     | Verbosity level for logs                             |     `info`     | `--log-level info`       |
| `--disable-trace` | Disable showing traces in logs                       |     `info`     | `--log-level info`       |
| `--config`        | Path to the configuration file <br> [Config Example] | `bifrost.yaml` | `--bifrost bifrost.yaml` |


> Output is thrown always in JSON as it is more suitable for automations

```console
bifrost run \
    --log-level=info
```
